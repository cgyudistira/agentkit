## 🤔 What Are "Skills"?

AI Agents (like **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Claude Code**) are smart, but they lack specific knowledge about your tools.
**Skills** are specialized instruction manuals (markdown files) that teach your AI how to perform specific tasks perfectly, every time.

**Analogy:** Your AI is a brilliant intern. **Skills** are the SOPs that make them a Senior Engineer.
